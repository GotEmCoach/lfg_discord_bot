# lfg_discord_bot
Made with the LFG Destiny 2 discord bot in mind, but could be amended for for other purposes


## Roadmap
standardize lfg input into channels
differentiate logic based depending on the D2 LFG Channel
introduce special options for those needing to specify their wants
introduce find a sherpa logic with labels learning, teaching, and veteran
setup structure to hold discord user's self defined destiny character traits
setup function to allow discord user to change D2 character traits at anytime
create structure for holding requests (OrderedDict, Queue)
create structure for partial_filled_groups (OrderedDict, Queue)
create structure for filled_groups
create function for private thread with processed d2 group
      users would corrobate for /join code in that private thread
create function to delete user lfg message in channel after processing
